    <button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Click Here</button>

    <script>
       let x; // here we can write also let x, y; or var x, y;
       var y;
       x = 5;
       y = 6;
       let z = x + y;
       function myFunction() {
         document.getElementById("yes").innerHTML = z; //NOTE HERE WE CAN PUT THE DIRACTILLY VALUE X + Y ALSO GIVE THE SAME OUTPUT.
       }

       //JavaScript Expressions:-
       /*1. 5 * 10 evaluates to 50
       2.Expressions can also contain variable values :=
       x = 5;
       document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x * 10;

       <p id="demo"></p>
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "John" + " "  + "Doe";
      o/p=John Doe


      JavaScript Keywords=
      1.The let keyword tells the browser to create variables/The var keyword also tells the browser to create variables::
       example= <h2>The <b>let</b> Keyword Creates Variables</h2>
       <script>
         let x, y;
         x = 5 + 6;
         y = x * 10;
         document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = y;
         <p id="demo"></p>
            o/p=The let Keyword Creates Variables
            110

            JavaScript Identifiers / Names
            A JavaScript name must begin with:

            A dollar sign ($)
            Or an underscore (_)
            A letter (A-Z or a-z)

            JavaScript is Case Sensitive:=The variables lastName and lastname, are two different variables

            // JavaScript Values two typw of value in which
            // 1 fixed value in which number and string
            // and second is variable value JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables



        Java script Camel case :-
        1.Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.(first-name, last-name, master-card, inter-city)
        2.Underscore:first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city.
        3.Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case):FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity.
        4.Lower Camel Case:firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity


        JavaScript Character Set:-JavaScript uses the Unicode character set.Unicode Transformation Format (UTF).
        The Unicode Standard has implemented in HTML, XML, Java, JavaScript, E-mail, ASP, PHP, etc. The Unicode standard is also supported in many operating systems and all modern browsers.

        The Unicode Consortium cooperates with the leading standards development organizations, like ISO, W3C, and ECMA.
        The Unicode Character Sets:-The most commonly used encodings are UTF-8 and UTF-16



        Character-set	Description
         UTF-8	         A character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long. UTF-8 can represent any character in the Unicode standard. UTF-8 is backwards compatible with ASCII. UTF-8 is the preferred encoding for e-mail and web pages
        UTF-16	         16-bit Unicode Transformation Format is a variable-length character encoding for Unicode, capable of encoding the entire Unicode repertoire. UTF-16 is used in major operating systems and environments, like Microsoft Windows, Java and .NET.

        HTML 4 supports UTF-8. HTML 5 supports both UTF-8 and UTF-16!
        The Unicode Standard covers (almost) all the characters, punctuations, and symbols in the world.
        Unicode enables processing, storage, and transport of text independent of platform and language.


        The default character encoding in HTML-5 is UTF-8
        If an HTML5 web page uses a different character set than UTF-8, it should be specified in the <meta> tag like:
        <meta charset="ISO-8859-1">



        The Difference Between Unicode and UTF-8:-
        1.Unicode is a character set. UTF-8 is encoding.
        2.Unicode is a list of characters with unique decimal numbers (code points). A = 65, B = 66, C = 67, ....
        3.This list of decimal numbers represent the string "hello": 104 101 108 108 111
        4.Encoding is how these numbers are translated into binary numbers to be stored in a computer:
        5.UTF-8 encoding will store "hello" like this (binary): 01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100  01101111
        6.Encoding translates numbers into binary. Character sets translates characters to numbers.
