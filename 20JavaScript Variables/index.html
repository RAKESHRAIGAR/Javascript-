      //What are Variables?

      //When to Use JavaScript var?
      /*Always declare JavaScript variables with var,let, orconst.
          The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.
          The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.
          If you want your code to run in older browsers, you must use var.*/

      //When to Use JavaScript const?
      /*If you want a general rule: always declare variables with const.
         If you think the value of the variable can change, use let.
         In this example, price1, price2, and total, are variables:*/

      const price1 = 10;
      const price2 = 20;
      let total = price1 + price2;
      document.getElementById("yes").innerHTML = "The total is: " + total;

      //Note:-Variables are containers for storing values.

      /*JavaScript Identifiers
      All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
      These unique names are called identifiers.
      Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

      The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
      1.Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
      2.Names must begin with a letter.
      3.Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
      4.Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
      5.Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
      NOTE:-JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.
