      Using let
      Using const
      Using nothing

      //What are Variables?

      //When to Use JavaScript var?
      /*Always declare JavaScript variables with var,let, orconst.
          The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.
          The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.
          If you want your code to run in older browsers, you must use var.*/

      //When to Use JavaScript const?
      /*If you want a general rule: always declare variables with const.
         If you think the value of the variable can change, use let.
         In this example, price1, price2, and total, are variables:*/

      const price1 = 10;
      const price2 = 20;
      let total = price1 + price2;
      document.getElementById("yes").innerHTML = "The total is: " + total;

      //Note:-Variables are containers for storing values.

      /*JavaScript Identifiers
      All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
      These unique names are called identifiers.
      Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

      The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
      1.Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
      2.Names must begin with a letter.
      3.Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
      4.Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
      5.Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
      NOTE:-JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive. */

      //The Assignment Operator:-x = x + 5  it assigns the value of x + 5 to x. The value of x is incremented by 5
      //Note:-The "equal to" operator is written like == in JavaScript.

      //JavaScript Data Types:-
      //1.Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.
      //2.If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.
      // Example is clear in index1.html and index2.html

      /*Declaring a JavaScript Variable:-
      Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.
      You declare a JavaScript variable with the var or the let keyword:
      examples/declaring:-var carName;  and  let carName;
      After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it is undefined).
      To assign a value to the variable, use the equal sign:
      carName = "Volvo";
      You can also assign a value to the variable when you declare it:
      let carName = "Volvo";
      In the example below, we create a variable called carName and assign the value "Volvo" to it.
      Then we "output" the value inside an HTML paragraph with id="demo":
      */

      //NOTE:- It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.

      /*One Statement, Many Variables
      1.You can declare many variables in one statement.
      2.Start the statement with let and separate the variables by comma:
      Example:-let person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;*/

      //Value = undefined
      //A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined.The variable carName will have the value undefined after the execution of this statement:
      //example in index5.html
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
