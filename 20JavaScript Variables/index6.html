    <h1>JavaScript Variables</h1>

    <p>If you re-declare a JavaScript variable, it will not lose its value.</p>

    <p id="demo"></p>
    <script>
      var tailWind = "shiv";
      var tailWind;
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = tailWind;

      // note:- it will happen only with the var variable another did not support
      /*As with algebra, you can do arithmetic with JavaScript variables, using operators like = and +:
      let x = 5 + 2 + 3;
      O/P IS =10
      You can also add strings, but strings will be concatenated:
      let x = "John" + " " + "Doe";
      O/P IS =John Doe

      let x = "5" + 2 + 3;
      The result of adding "5" + 2 + 3 is:
      523
      note:-If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated.

      let x = 2 + 3 + "5";
      The result of adding 2 + 3 + "5" is:
      55

      JavaScript Dollar Sign $
      let $ = "Hello World";
      let $myMoney = 5;
      let $$$ = 2;
      Since JavaScript treats a dollar sign as a letter, identifiers containing $ are valid variable names:
      In the JavaScript library jQuery, for instance, the main function $ is used to select HTML elements. In jQuery $("p"); means "select all p elements".

      JavaScript Underscore (_):-
      Since JavaScript treats underscore as a letter, identifiers containing _ are valid variable names:
      let _x = 2;
      let _100 = 5;
      O/P IS = 7
